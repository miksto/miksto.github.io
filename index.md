# Projects overview

Here you will find some of my projects that I have included either just for fun or, as in the case of the seismometer, for informative purposes.

## Vertical Pendulum Seismometer

When I moved to Tokyo, I developed a fascination with earthquakes, which inspired me to construct my own seismometer. To my astonishment, I began detecting seismic activities not just locally, but from all around the world â€” sometimes even from the farthest corners of the globe.

Check out the [seismometer project description](/seismometer) for a detailed guide on how it was built, including the electronics and the software components.

## Bluetooth Controlled LED lamp
A LED lamp that's based on an ESP32 and is controlled using an Android application via Bluetooth.

Visit the [led-lamp project description](/led-lamp) to see pictures and learn how the lamp was constructed.

## Cheapest Metro Card in Stockholm

## Stuff From The Past
