# Projects overview

Here you will find some of my projects that I have included either just for fun or, as in the case of the seismometer, for informative purposes.

## Vertical Pendulum Seismometer

After moving to Tokyo I got interested in earthquakes and decided to build my own seismometer. Much to my surprise i started picking up earthquakes from all over the world. Sometimes even from the opposite side of the globe.

Visit the [Project description](/seismometer) for a walkthrough of the custruction of it, the electronics as well as the software.

## Bluetooth Controlled LED lamp
A LED lamp based on an ESP32 which controlled using an Android application and Bluetooth. 

Visit the [Project description](/led-lamp) to see pictures and learn how the lamp was constructed.

## Cheapest Metro Card in Stockholm
A webpage that suggests the cheapest metro card based on how long time you will be staying in Stockholm, and how much you will travel.

## Stuff From The Past

[Family home page](/family-page) created at around age 10.

[Another random web page](/derp-page) I created as a child. Beware of many popups and other "fun" stuff.
