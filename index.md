# My projects

Here you will find some of my projects that I have included either just for fun or, as in the case of the seismometer, for informative purposes.

## Vertical Pendulum Seismometer

After moving to Tokyo I got interested in earthquakes and decided to build my own seismometer.

[Project description](/seismometer)
A walkthrough of the seismometer as well as the software to collect and present the data.

[Seismometer web frontend](http://seismometer.micke.stockman.se/vertical_pendulum)
View live seismometer data and other plots from the last day.

## Temperature monitoring web page

A web page displaying the current temperature in my room as well as graphs with historical data from up to one year ago.

## Stuff from the past

[Family home page](/family-page) created at around age 10.

[Another random web page](/derp-page) I created as a child. Beware of many popups and and other "fun" stuff.
